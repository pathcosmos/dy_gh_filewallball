## üìã Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- uv (Python package manager)
- Git

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fileWallBall.git
cd fileWallBall

# Install dependencies
uv sync --dev

# Set up pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install

# Verify setup
uv run python scripts/verify_setup.py
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Run tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-cov

# Format code
make format

# Lint code
make lint

# Run development server
make run

# Clean cache files
make clean
```

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

We use the following tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black**: Code formatting
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **flake8**: Linting
- **mypy**: Type checking

### Code Formatting

All code should be formatted using Black with the following settings:
- Line length: 88 characters
- Target Python version: 3.11+

### Import Organization

Imports should be organized using isort with the following order:
1. Standard library imports
2. Third-party imports
3. Local application imports

Example:
```python
import os
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import List, Optional

import pytest
from fastapi import FastAPI
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

from app.core.config import get_config
from app.models.database import Base
```

### Type Annotations

- Use type annotations for all function parameters and return values
- Use `Optional[T]` for parameters that can be `None`
- Use `Union[T1, T2]` or `T1 | T2` for union types
- Use `List[T]`, `Dict[K, V]`, etc. for generic types

Example:
```python
from typing import List, Optional

def process_files(files: List[str], max_size: Optional[int] = None) -> bool:
    """Process a list of files."""
    pass
```

### Documentation

- Use docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Follow Google-style docstring format
- Include type information in docstrings

Example:
```python
def upload_file(file_path: str, user_id: str) -> dict:
    """Upload a file to the system.

    Args:
        file_path: Path to the file to upload
        user_id: ID of the user uploading the file

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing upload result information

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the file doesn't exist
        ValueError: If the file is too large
    """
    pass
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

- Unit tests go in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests go in `tests/integration/`
- End-to-end tests go in `tests/e2e/`
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested

### Test Naming

- Test files should be named `test_*.py`
- Test functions should be named `test_*`
- Test classes should be named `Test*`

Example:
```python
def test_file_upload_with_valid_file():
    """Test file upload with a valid file."""
    pass

def test_file_upload_with_invalid_file_type():
    """Test file upload with an invalid file type."""
    pass
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Focus on testing business logic and edge cases
- Use fixtures for common test data and setup

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_config.py

# Run tests with coverage
make test-cov

# Run tests with specific markers
uv run pytest -m "unit"
uv run pytest -m "integration"
```

## üìù Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

- Add POST /upload endpoint
- Add file validation
- Add file storage service

Closes #123
```

```
fix(auth): resolve authentication token validation issue

The authentication token validation was failing for tokens with
special characters. This fix properly handles URL-safe base64
encoding.

Fixes #456
```

```
docs: update API documentation

- Add examples for all endpoints
- Update response schemas
- Fix typos in descriptions
```
